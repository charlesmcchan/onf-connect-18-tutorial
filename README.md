# TRELLIS+P4 Tutorial

Welcome to the TRELLIS+P4 tutorial! The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to
use Trellis to control a leaf-spine fabric of P4-capable devices using ONOS, and
how you can use `fabric.p4` (the reference P4 program used by Trellis) to
perform advanced packet processing such as VNF offloading.

## Tutorial VM

To complete the exercises, you will need to download and run the tutorial VM.
Ask the instructors for information on how to obtain such VM.

To run the VM you can use any modern virtualization system, although we
recommend using VirtualBox. To download VirtualBox and import the VM use the
following links:

* <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>
* <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html>

### VM credentials

The VM comes with one user with sudo privileges. Use these credentials to log in:

* Username: `sdn`
* Password: `rocks`

## ONOS version

This tutorial is based on the development branch of ONOS version 1.14:
<https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/tree/onos-1.14>

## Overview

Before starting, we suggest to open the `trellis-p4-tutorial` directory
in your editor of choice for easier access to the different files used in the
exercises. For example, if using the Atom editor:

```
$ atom ~/trellis-p4-tutorial
```

### fabric.p4

These exercises are based on `fabric.p4`, the P4 implementation of the reference
Trellis data plane pipeline. The source code of fabric.p4 and its ONOS pipeconf
implementation can be found here:
<https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/tree/onos-1.14/pipelines/fabric>.

Some useful files are:

* [fabric.p4](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/blob/onos-1.14/pipelines/fabric/src/main/resources/fabric.p4):
Top level file of the P4 implementation.

* [Makefile](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/blob/onos-1.14/pipelines/fabric/src/main/resources/Makefile):
Used to compile the different profiles of `fabric.p4`, such as `fabric-spgw`,
`fabric-int`, etc. This file specifies the preprocessor flags used by the P4
compiler for each profile.

* [spgw.p4](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/blob/onos-1.14/pipelines/fabric/src/main/resources/include/spgw.p4):
P4 implementation for the S/PGW functionality integrated in the `fabric-spgw`
profile. This implementation provides the tables and actions to perform GTP
encapsulation and decapsulation.

* [Pipeconf Java implementation](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos/tree/onos-1.14/pipelines/fabric/src/main/java/org/onosproject/pipelines/fabric):
Here is where we implement, among other things, the Pipeliner, which is the ONOS
driver behavior providing the logic to translate the Trellis FlowObjectives to
the FlowRules specific to the `fabric.p4` pipeline.

## Tutorial exercises

### Lab 1

[Click here to go to this exercise instructions](lab1/README.md)

This exercise shows how to set up an emulated Trellis environment with a simple
2x2 topology of BMv2 software switches programmed with the basic `fabric`
profile. In this exercise, you will have to modify the network configuration
file (netcfg) to add a new interface and provide connectivity for a new host.

### Exercise 2

[Click here to go to this exercise instructions](lab2/README.md)

This exercise shows how to use and control the S/PGW functionality integrated in
the `fabric-spgw` profile to encapsulate packets using the GTP header directly
in the switch.
