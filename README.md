TODO

To run this exercise you will need multiple terminal windows (or tabs) to
operate with the CLI of Mininet and ONOS. We use the following convention
to distinguish between commands of different CLIs:

* Commands starting with `$` are intended to be executed in the Ubuntu terminal
    prompt;
* `onos>` for commands in the ONOS CLI;
* `mininet>` for the Mininet CLI.
